# TransFetch_TLB

Modified versions of TransFetch (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3528416.3530236), optimised for TLB prefetching.

Each model is trained in a different way, with changes being made to input data in order to assess training capabilities based on available input data, subsets of data used and timeliness of information.
